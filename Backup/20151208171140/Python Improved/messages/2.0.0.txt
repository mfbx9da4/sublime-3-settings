Python Improved v2.0.0
======================

After much blood (well, a little), sweat (sorry, it's a gland problem), and tears
(yup, some), version 2.0 is finally here! It was originally timed to coincide
with the release of Python 3.5 a few weeks ago, but a particularly nasty bug
reared its ugly head at the last minute (like usual) and threatened to end the
whole party until @facelessuser rode to the rescue at the last minute and saved
the day! This release is dedicated to him. Thanks, buddy!

There have been *many* changes in PI. First and foremost, Unicode is now supported
pretty much everywhere. That means you can name a function (or any identifier you
want) Привет_мир, or 我喜欢奶酪, or Kolbász_finom, or whatever you like. Sublime
Text 2 seems to have issues with some Unicode, especially combining marks, so if
you find a bug first upgrade to Sublime Text 3 (http://sublimetext.com/3 or /3dev)
to see if that helps.

Other than that, a lot of work has been done internally to reorganize things, and
clearly define if something is, for example, the name of a builtin function or a
builtin function being called. For you Python 2 fans out there, `print` without
parentheses is now scoped as a keyword, but with parens is a builtin function. All
of the builtins, magic methods/attributes, errors, keywords and so on have been
updated for Python 3.5, while still retaining all of the Python 2.7 ones. At last,
... is highlighted as support.type.ellipsis.

To take full advantage of the extra scopes included in Python Improved, check out
the Neon Color Scheme at https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Neon%20Color%20Scheme
If you'd rather modify your own color scheme, a list of scopes is included in
the README.md on GitHub at https://github.com/MattDMo/PythonImproved#readme

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, bugs, or patches, please open an
issue or pull request on GitHub and I'll do what I can to help out. You can also
email me directly at <mattdmo@pigimal.com> or find me on Twitter at @MattDMo.
This is definitely a work in progress, so if you'd like to contribute I'd love
to hear from you!
