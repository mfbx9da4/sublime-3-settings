SublimePythonIDE was just updated to a new minor version. The detection of the Python interpreter to use was improved. It now uses four different methods in the following order (see README or Github for details):

  - Check for the option "python_interpreter" in project settings
  - Try to auto-detect virtual environments (in "venv" or $WORKON_HOME for virtualenvwrapper)
  - Read a #! (shebang) line in the active file (NEW)
  - Try to auto-detect the system Python from $PATH

In addition, the bundled libraries were updated and open issues were fixed.
